### Design Specification
#### For Data Visualization:
Anaconda is a distribution of the Python that aims to simplify packages. Many visualizations which are not supported in colab are supported in Anaconda jupyter notebooks.  
#### Project Implementation
Free python Jupyter environment from Google known as Colab is used for the implementation of this project. For implementing machine learning projects, Colab is one of the well known cloud environment in research community. For ML projects, it supports many packages and one doesnâ€™t need to install different packages. Sessions in Colab is equipped with either a GPU, CPU or TPU processor and a 13 GB of ram being run by a virtual machine. For Colab, the hardware specification is different for different projects. This project is executed on a ram of 13GB with 120Gb drive-space along with the aid of GPU processor.
